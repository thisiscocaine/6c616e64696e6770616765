# Cyberattacks: Types, Methods, and Prevention

Every day, individuals, organizations, and even governments are targeted by malware, phishing, DDoS, and countless other types of cyberattacks. While many believe it won’t happen to them, cyberattacks can be devastating for anyone.

Exposed sensitive information, drained bank accounts, and stolen identities are just a few of the terrifying consequences. Fortunately, there are ways to protect yourself — and understanding the threats is the first step to staying safe.

## 🔐 What Is a Cyberattack?

A **cyberattack** is a deliberate attempt to compromise computers, networks, or digital infrastructures. These attacks may be driven by:

- Financial gain  
- Revenge  
- Ideological motives  
- Notoriety (especially among high-profile targets)

Cyberattacks may originate from:

- Individuals (e.g., hackers)  
- Criminal organizations  
- Nation-states (also known as cyber warfare)  
- Internal actors (e.g., insiders with authorized access)

## 🧠 Methods of Attack

Before we explore specific types, it’s important to understand the **methods** used to deliver cyberattacks. They fall into four main categories:

### 1. Passive Attacks
Non-disruptive and stealthy, these attacks aim to collect sensitive data without detection. Often used in cyber espionage.

### 2. Active Attacks
These are aggressive, destructive assaults that target systems, networks, or infrastructure with the intent to disrupt or destroy.

### 3. Insider Attacks
Initiated by trusted individuals who have legitimate access, such as employees or contractors.

### 4. Outsider Attacks
Conducted by individuals or entities without authorized access — from cybercriminals to hostile states.

## 🛠️ Hacker Techniques & Common Cyberattacks

Here are some of the most widely used methods cybercriminals deploy:

### ✅ DDoS Attack
A **Distributed Denial-of-Service** attack overwhelms a service, server, or network with traffic from multiple sources, rendering it inaccessible to legitimate users.

### ✅ Malware
Short for “malicious software,” malware includes viruses, spyware, adware, ransomware, and more. It can steal, damage, or encrypt your data.

### ✅ Social Engineering
Tricks users into handing over sensitive data or installing malware. Tactics often include phishing emails and fake websites posing as trustworthy sources.

### ✅ Man-in-the-Middle (MitM)
The attacker secretly intercepts communication between two parties and may alter or steal the data in transit.

### ✅ Zero-Day Exploits
Targets unpatched vulnerabilities before the software vendor can issue a fix. These are extremely dangerous.

### ✅ Dumpster Diving
Attackers scavenge discarded physical or digital data (like paper files or deleted emails) to extract sensitive information.

### ✅ Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
Malicious scripts are injected into trusted websites to steal login details or session tokens from users.

### ✅ Password Cracking
Hackers use brute-force attacks, dictionary attacks, or rainbow tables to guess user passwords.

### ✅ SQL Injection
Malicious SQL code is injected into input fields of a vulnerable web app to extract or manipulate database contents.

## 🛡️ How to Prevent Cyber Threats

Cybersecurity is a continuous process. Here are proven practices to help defend against common threats:

### 🧰 Use Antivirus Software
Install a reliable antivirus program and consider additional tools like **NordVPN’s Threat Protection** to:
- Block malware and intrusive ads  
- Warn you about dangerous websites  
- Prevent tracking and data collection

### 🧩 Keep Software Updated
Always install updates. They contain critical security patches for known vulnerabilities.

### 🚫 Avoid Public Wi-Fi Hotspots
Public networks are a common hunting ground for attackers. Avoid them when possible.

### 🔒 Use a VPN
A **VPN** encrypts your internet traffic, keeping your data private on any network — especially public Wi-Fi.

### 🕵️ Limit Personal Info Online
Details like your birth date or hometown can help attackers guess passwords or answers to security questions.

### 🌐 Use Secure Browser Extensions
Add-ons such as:
- Ad blockers  
- Anti-tracking tools  
- Malware site blockers  
can significantly improve your browsing safety.

### 📲 Download Only from Trusted Sources
Use official app stores (e.g., Google Play, App Store) to avoid trojan-laced or fake apps.

### ❌ Don’t Click Suspicious Links
If a link looks too good to be true, it probably is.  
**Tip:** Hover your mouse over a link to preview the real URL before clicking.
