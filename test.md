# Cyberattacks: Types, Methods, and Prevention

Every day, people, organizations, and even governments are hit by malware, phishing, DDoS, and countless other types of cyberattacks. And while no one thinks it will happen to them, cyberattacks can be disastrous for anyone.

Exposed sensitive information, drained bank accounts, and stolen identities are just a few of the terrifying consequences of a cyberattack. But there are ways you can protect yourself — and knowing what's out there can help you stay safe.

## 🔐 What is a Cyberattack?

A **cyberattack** is a broad term that refers to any deliberate assault on computers, devices, networks, or infrastructures. These attacks may be motivated by:

- Financial gain  
- Revenge  
- Ideology  
- Notoriety (especially in high-profile targets)

Cyberattacks may come from individuals (like hackers) or organizations, and may target:

- People  
- Businesses  
- Governments (cyber warfare)

## 🧠 Methods of Attack

Before exploring common types, let’s break down **how** cyberattacks are carried out. There are four primary methods:

### 1. Passive Attacks
Non-disruptive attacks used to secretly collect sensitive information without the victim’s knowledge — e.g., cyber espionage.

### 2. Active Attacks
Aggressive and disruptive attacks meant to destroy or interfere with devices, networks, or infrastructure.

### 3. Insider Attacks
Attacks by individuals who already have legitimate access to the system (employees, contractors, etc.).

### 4. Outsider Attacks
External threats from hackers, cybercriminals, or even foreign governments.

## 🛠️ Hacker Techniques & Common Cyberattacks

Here are the most common cyberattack techniques used in the wild:

### ✅ DDoS Attack
**Distributed Denial-of-Service** attacks overwhelm a service or server with fake traffic, making it unavailable for legitimate users.

### ✅ Malware
Malicious software that can steal data, bombard with ads, or lock your files for ransom (ransomware).

### ✅ Social Engineering
Tricks users into sharing data or installing malware. Often involves fake emails or websites pretending to be trusted.

### ✅ Man-in-the-Middle (MitM)
An attacker intercepts communication between a user and a service, reading or modifying the data.

### ✅ Zero-Day Exploits
Takes advantage of newly discovered vulnerabilities before the developer can release a fix.

### ✅ Dumpster Diving
Attackers search trash (physical or digital) for documents or data they can exploit.

### ✅ Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
Injects malicious scripts into trusted websites to steal user data or hijack sessions.

### ✅ Password Cracking
Uses brute-force, dictionary attacks, or rainbow tables to guess and steal passwords.

### ✅ SQL Injection
Injects malicious SQL code into a database via vulnerable input fields to extract or manipulate data.

## 🛡️ How to Prevent Cyber Threats

Cybersecurity is a journey — not a one-time task. Here are actionable tips to protect yourself from cyberattacks:

### 🧰 Use Antivirus Software
Install trusted antivirus tools. Consider advanced protection like **NordVPN Threat Protection** to:
- Scan for malware
- Block trackers and ads
- Stop you from accessing malicious sites

### 🧩 Keep Software Updated
Install updates regularly. Most updates include **critical security patches**.

### 🚫 Avoid Public Wi-Fi Hotspots
They're often unsecured and prime targets for attackers.

### 🔒 Use a VPN
Encrypts your connection on public Wi-Fi, preventing eavesdropping.

### 🕵️ Limit Personal Info Online
Avoid sharing sensitive personal details (birthdate, hometown, etc.) which can be used in social engineering attacks.

### 🌐 Use Secure Browser Extensions
Install reputable:
- Ad blockers
- Anti-tracking plugins
- Phishing & malware protection extensions

### 📲 Only Download from Trusted Sources
Use official app stores to avoid trojans or malware-laden apps.

### ❌ Don’t Click Suspicious Links
Be skeptical of “too good to be true” offers.  
**Pro Tip**: Hover over links before clicking to preview their destination.
