# Types of IP Addresses: All You Need to Know

**Published on: December 29, 2023**

IP addresses are unique identifiers that enable devices on a network to communicate with each other and the internet. Different types of IP addresses—such as IPv4, IPv6, public, private, dynamic, and static—have distinct characteristics and purposes. This article explores these types in detail to help you understand their roles and applications.

## What is an IP Address?

An **Internet Protocol (IP) address** is a unique numerical identifier assigned to every device (e.g., computers, smartphones, routers) connected to a network. It facilitates communication between devices on local networks and the internet. For example, when you search for “What is a VPN?” on Google, your IP address sends the request to Google’s servers, which then return the response to your device using your IP address.

## Structure of an IP Address

The structure of an IP address depends on its version: **IPv4** or **IPv6**.

- **IPv4**: The most widely used version, consisting of a 32-bit binary number divided into four groups of eight bits, separated by dots (e.g., `192.168.1.1`). Each group ranges from 0 to 255, providing approximately 4.3 billion unique addresses.
- **IPv6**: Introduced in 1995 to address IPv4’s limitations, IPv6 uses 128 bits, represented as eight groups of four hexadecimal digits separated by colons (e.g., `2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334`). This allows for a vastly larger number of unique addresses.

## Types of IP Addresses

IP addresses are categorized based on their version, scope, usage, and assignment method:

- **IPv4 and IPv6**: Differ in structure and capacity.
- **Public and Private**: Used for internet or internal network communication, respectively.
- **Dynamic and Static**: Change periodically or remain fixed.

Let’s explore these types in detail.

---

## Private IP Addresses

**Private IP addresses** are used within private networks (e.g., homes, offices) for internal device communication. They are assigned by routers or servers via the **Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)** and are not routable on the public internet, enhancing security.

The **RFC 1918** standard reserves the following private IP ranges:

- `10.0.0.0 – 10.255.255.255` (10.0.0.0/8)
- `172.16.0.0 – 172.31.255.255` (172.16.0.0/12)
- `192.168.0.0 – 192.168.255.255` (192.168.0.0/16)

### Benefits:
- **Security**: Not exposed to public internet threats.
- **Reusability**: The same private IP ranges can be used across different networks.

### Limitations:
- Require **Network Address Translation (NAT)** or a **VPN** to access the public internet.

---

## Public IP Addresses

**Public IP addresses** are globally unique identifiers assigned by **Internet Service Providers (ISPs)** and managed by **Regional Internet Registries (RIRs)**. They enable devices to communicate over the public internet. All devices on the same network (e.g., your home Wi-Fi) share a single public IP address via the router.

### Characteristics:
- Change periodically if dynamic, or remain fixed if static.
- Used for tasks like browsing, hosting websites, or running servers.
- Raise privacy concerns, as they can be used to track online activities or expose devices to cyberattacks.

---

## Dynamic IP Addresses

**Dynamic IP addresses** are automatically assigned by ISPs via DHCP and change at regular intervals or when a device reconnects to the network. They are the default for most home and personal devices.

### Advantages:
- **Ease of Management**: No manual configuration required.
- **Enhanced Security**: Frequent changes make tracking harder.
- **Cost-Effective**: Typically included in standard ISP plans.

### Use Cases:
- Everyday internet browsing, streaming, and personal device connectivity.

---

## Static IP Addresses

**Static IP addresses** remain constant over time and are manually configured or assigned by a DHCP server. They are ideal for services requiring consistent addressing.

### Advantages:
- **Reliability**: Consistent IP simplifies hosting websites, servers, or remote access.
- **Use Cases**: Web hosting, email servers, VPN servers, port forwarding.

### Disadvantages:
- **Higher Cost**: Often requires additional fees from ISPs.
- **Security Risks**: Fixed addresses are easier to target.

## Dedicated vs. Shared IP Addresses

Websites and online services use either **dedicated** or **shared IP addresses**, with key differences:

| Feature          | Dedicated IP                     | Shared IP                       |
|------------------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| **Ownership**    | Exclusive to one user/device     | Shared among multiple users     |
| **Usage**        | Single device/service            | Shared hosting, multiple devices|
| **Reputation**   | Affected only by the user        | Impacted by all users’ activity |
| **Cost**         | More expensive                   | Cost-effective                  |

### Alternative: NordVPN Meshnet
For enhanced security, NordVPN’s **Meshnet** allows users to route traffic through connected devices (e.g., your home computer) using your home IP address remotely, offering a secure alternative to dedicated IPs.

---

## Subnetting

**Subnetting** divides a large network into smaller subnetworks (subnets) to improve performance, security, and resource management. A **subnet mask** defines the network and host portions of an IP address, enabling efficient IP assignment and traffic management.

### Benefits:
- Reduces network congestion.
- Enhances security by isolating subnetworks.
- Simplifies network administration for enterprises and data centers.

---

## Other Types of IP Addresses

Beyond standard types, specialized IP addresses serve unique purposes:

- **Multicast IP**: Sends data from one device to multiple devices simultaneously (e.g., video streaming, online gaming).
- **Broadcast IP**: Sends data to all devices on a network.
- **Default Gateway IP**: The router’s IP address, connecting a local network to the internet.
- **Localhost IP**: Refers to the device itself (e.g., `127.0.0.1`), used for testing network services.

---

## IP Addresses with VPNs

When using a **VPN** (e.g., NordVPN), you are typically assigned a **shared IP address**, which multiple users access simultaneously. This enhances privacy by making it harder for websites to track individual users.

### Pros:
- **Privacy**: Shared IPs obscure your identity.
- **Access**: Bypasses geo-restrictions or censorship.

### Cons:
- **Bad Neighbor Effect**: If another user on the same IP is blocklisted, you may face access issues or increased CAPTCHA requests.

> **Note**: Dynamic IPs enhance security with frequent changes, while static IPs offer stability for hosting. Choose based on your needs—privacy or consistency.
